<h1><i><span style="background-color:orange;color:blue">My trip to London</span></i></h1>
My name is Tomer, Im 42 years old a musician who moved to Stockholm, Sweden. 
<br>I can tell you more about <a href="file:///C:/Html/index.html" target="_blank">my rock n´roll journey</a> here
<p>Usually I am not that spontaneous person <br>but it has been a while since I was in London and I miss that place.
<p><b><i> The main two reasons I went to London were :
<Ul>
<li><span style="color:red">Freddie Mercury exhibition </span></li>
<li><span style="color:red">Birdy concert</span></li>
</Ul>
 
I am a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)" target="_blank">Queen</a> fan and it was an oppertunity which I couldn´t resist, 
to see all of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQZ9vN1ubz8" target="_blank">Freddie Mercury personal items</a> 
before it will go for public auction.<br>
The highlight of this exhibition was to see his personal Piano where he wrote the hit song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ" target="_blank">Bohemian Rhapsody,</a><br>
original songs sheets that he wrote back in the days, and to have the chance to look on his personal life since it was hide from public through the years.<p><u>Here are some of the famouse items that were sold in the exhibition:</u></p>
 <br> The grand Yamaha piano which was sold for $2.2 million

 <p>Freddie Mercury´s crown and cloack

<p>My second reason was to be in a concert of the singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdy_(singer)" target="_blank">Birdy</a>, which I discovered her recently and since I love live concerts 
<br>I decided to combine the concert with my staying in London.
One of my favourite song by her is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJTXDCh2YiA" target="_blank">"Wings"</a>
<br><img src="Images/birdy.jpg" />
 
<p>My trip also included a visit in Camden market <br><img src="Images/camden market.jpg" /> <br>which I find always fascinating at finding clothes and other items that I can find only there. <p>One of the most unique places I had the chance to visit was the special restaurant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUVDo6us8xY" target="_blank">Karen´s diner</a>
which is known for there concept of terrible service bad good food.<br>
 
I am looking forward for the next time I will be in London again.
